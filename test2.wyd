            Max: It's cool. I was eating.
            Rachel: Oh, good. So you won't mind if I do? I kept running into distractions. I haven't even had time to eat all day.
            Now that I take a good look at her, I see that Rachel really looks like she's been in a rush. I'm glad I decided to be patient. She's always got so much on her plate.
            Max Of course I don't mind.
            I look beyond her shoulder. The "skater bros" are all hanging out by the steps, like they always are. One of them waves at us...or maybe just at Rachel. I know she hangs out with them a lot. I don't know how one person manages to fit into so many social groups.
            Max: You'd break their hearts. Justin's clearly drooling. I can see it all the way from here.
            Rachel: Hell, yeah, I'd crush 'em. I wanna be a maneater!
            Max: I thought you wanted to be a model.
            Rachel: Part and parcel, Max.
            She grins at me. It's so bright and warm. Rachel's smile has a way of making you feel special. Like she's totally happy to be devoting all of her attention to you. Maybe that's her secret to popularity.
            Max: Well, I need you to keep it to modeling for this contest... If that's cool with you.
            Rachel: Ice cold.
            I cringe. Open mouth, insert foot much, self?
            Max: I'm sorryâ€”
            Rachel: I mean it's cool, Max!
            Max: Oh. Of course.
            She laughs. I feel embarrassed. Of course I misunderstood. I'm reminded again of how there's a lot I still don't know about Rachel. Is it that I'm totally socially awkward, or is it that she's an enigma? Maybe it's a bit of both.
            Rachel: Anyway, I am so excited for this thing.
            Max: Really? I mean, me too, but...
            Rachel: Come on. Sit with me over there.
            Before I can respond, Rachel is reaching down to loop her arms around one of mine. She locks her grip on me, and I try not to stumble as I stand. Rachel leans into me, smiling, and she tugs me towards a tree.
            I'm a little startled, but Rachel's always been really physical. She's always tapping your shoulder, or reaching for your arm, or hugging you to say hi. I like that about her. She's so extroverted compared to me.
            (Birds chirp)
            It's quieter here, away from the sound of the fountain.
            Rachel only lets go of me once she moves to sit, and she pats the grass beside herself, unwrapping a granola bar as she talks.
            Rachel: I'm so fucking stoked you asked me to do this with you.
            Hearing her say it like that...I believe her. But why?
            Max: You're doing me a huge favor, so if there's anything I can do for you, like if you get a project later in the year that you need help with, I'm there. I know a photography contest probably seems a little lame to you...
            Rachel: A favor? What? I'm doing this for me!
            Max: Huh?
            Rachel: Well, for you, too.
            Her expression softens. It lets me know that she's teasing. Rachel's always like that. It drives Chloe nuts.
            Rachel: It's not lame. I think it's awesome. And I'm glad you asked me to be your partner. I mean...I want to be a model, and you want to be a photographer. So we're a perfect match for this thing, right?
            A perfect match, huh?
            Max: Well, when you put it that way...
            Rachel: My logic's flawless.
            Seeing how confident Rachel is, I feel a little better about everything already.
